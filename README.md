# react-portfolio
A workshop for ReactJS.

## What exactly do I have to do?
1. Download/clone the repository (zip/git).
2. `cd` in repository.
2. Open the repository in a code editor. If you don't have one on your machine, [download Atom](https://atom.io).
3. If you haven't already, please [install a stable version of Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).
4. Do `npm install`, which could take some time.
6. `cd` into the empty/ directory.
7. `gulp` or `../node_modules/.bin/gulp`.
8. Open up `empty/index.html` in your browser.
9. You might want a syntax highlighter for JSX/Babel. Do so by installing the [language-babel package](https://atom.io/packages/language-babel) from the Atom interface and select *Javascript (Babel)* at the lower left corner of Atom in your JSX files.
